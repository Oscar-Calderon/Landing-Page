# About this project

Landing page using HTML and CSS-Flexbox

# Credits

I took the opportunity to make a website design for an artist client, showcasing her characters and world.

All characters and artwork belong to @Caminukai over on Twitter.

# What did I learn

I learned to use flexbox and more direct styling using CSS to make an attractive website.

# Future Improvements

Clean up the code more using better coding practices.
